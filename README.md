# Green Ecolution

This is the main repository for the Green Ecolution project. It contains the submodules for the different parts of the project like the backend and the frontend. Also it contains the documentation for the project in the Wiki and the issues for the project.

The project is developed by a group of students from the University of Flensburg as part of the course "Software Development Project".

## Local Deployment
Clone the repo and the submodules. You may need to update the submodules separately. Each submodule has its own description of how to deploy and develop locally.

```
git clone git@github.com:green-ecolution/green-ecolution-management.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
